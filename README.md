# Creator Notes:

Hi our names are Nerwys and Joi. We have created this card game called Go Fish. The purpose of the game is for the player to go against the computer and to end the game with no cards in the deck by competing and asking each other if they have specific cards. If either the player or the computer don't have that card they are being asked, they have to go fish and then the game will keep going until the computer and the player have no more cards and if there are no cards in the deck. We hope that you guys enjoy our game. 

Thank you for playing our game!
